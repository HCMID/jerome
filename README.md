# Jerome's *Chronicles*


In 2022-2023, the initial focus of HC MID's new Jerome teams will be focusing on Bibliothèque de Genève, Ms. lat. 49.  (See the team's [github repository](https://github.com/HCMID/gen49).)

## Background

Scribes working on chronological texts like Jerome's *Chronicles* did not aim to copy a sacred text. They were producing a functional text to be *used*, and often attempted to reconcile or accommodate conflicting or inconsistent chronologies.  These documents richly repay individual study.

The three manuscripts considered in the repositories linked below are all accessible thanks to the ground-breaking [e-codices project](http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en).

## Earlier work


In the first years of HC MID, teams worked on editing Jerome's *Chronicles* in these github repositories:
